## **Opening Introduction (15 minutes)**

### **Welcome & Context Setting:**

**"Good morning everyone, and welcome to our 3-day AWS Control Tower and Landing Zone intensive training. I'm [Your Name], and I'll be your instructor for this hands-on journey into enterprise-grade AWS governance.**

**Before we dive in, let me set some important context about what we're going to accomplish together and some critical guidelines we need to follow."**

### **Training Overview:**

**"Over the next 3 days, you'll transform from Control Tower beginners to practitioners who can implement and manage enterprise-scale AWS environments. Here's our journey:"**

- **Day 1:** Fresh Control Tower deployment from scratch
- **Day 2:** Real-world integration of existing AWS accounts
- **Day 3:** Advanced configuration, troubleshooting, and operational excellence
- **Day 4:** Self-paced reference materials for continued learning

**"This isn't just theory - you'll be working with real AWS accounts, deploying actual Control Tower environments, and solving realistic challenges that you'll face in production."**

## **Critical Account Usage Guidelines (10 minutes)**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ACCOUNT WARNINGS:**

**"Before we touch anything, let me be crystal clear about our AWS account usage. This is CRITICAL for everyone's safety and the success of our training."**

#### **Account Ownership & Responsibility:**

- **"You are working with REAL AWS accounts that incur REAL costs"**
- **"These accounts are provided for training purposes ONLY"**
- **"Any resources you create will be monitored and must be cleaned up"**
- **"Estimated cost per team for 3 days: $20-50 if we follow procedures"**

#### **Strict Usage Rules:**

```
DO:
‚úÖ Follow lab instructions exactly as written
‚úÖ Use only the services and regions specified in labs
‚úÖ Apply cost allocation tags to ALL resources you create
‚úÖ Work within your assigned team accounts ONLY
‚úÖ Ask before deviating from lab procedures

DO NOT:
‚ùå Create resources outside of lab instructions
‚ùå Use expensive instance types (stick to t3.micro, t3.small)
‚ùå Deploy resources in unauthorized regions
‚ùå Access other teams' accounts
‚ùå Leave resources running overnight without instructor approval
‚ùå Share account credentials outside your team
```

#### **Cost Management Responsibility:**

**"Each team will set up cost monitoring on Day 1. If your team exceeds $100 in costs, we'll need to investigate immediately. This is a hard limit for training purposes."**

#### **Account Access Protocol:**

- **"You'll receive temporary credentials that expire daily"**
- **"Credentials will be rotated each morning for security"**
- **"If you lose access, notify me immediately - don't try to troubleshoot alone"**
- **"All account activity is logged and monitored"**

## **Team Structure & Logistics (10 minutes)**

### **Team Formation:**

**"We're going to work in 2 teams of 4 people each. This mirrors real-world Control Tower implementations where cross-functional teams collaborate."**

#### **Team Roles & Responsibilities:**

```
Each team will have:
üëë Team Lead - Overall coordination, decisions, presentations
üîí Security Specialist - Guardrails, compliance, IAM policies
üåê Network Engineer - VPC design, connectivity, routing
‚öôÔ∏è Operations Engineer - Monitoring, logging, automation
```

**"Don't worry if you're not an expert in your assigned role - that's the point. You'll learn by doing, and your teammates will help you."**

#### **Team Account Allocation:**

```
Team 1 Environment:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ techcorp-team1-master (Control Tower master)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ techcorp-team1-existing-prod (pre-populated production)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ techcorp-team1-existing-dev (pre-populated development)

Team 2 Environment:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ techcorp-team2-master (Control Tower master)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ techcorp-team2-existing-prod (pre-populated production)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ techcorp-team2-existing-dev (pre-populated development)
```

### **Collaboration Expectations:**

- **"Teams work independently but share knowledge"**
- **"Help each other, but don't do the work for other teams"**
- **"We'll have regular cross-team sharing sessions"**
- **"Document everything - you'll thank me later"**

---

## **Daily Flow & Expectations (10 minutes)**

### **Daily Schedule Pattern:**

```
Each Day Structure:

13:30-17:00 - Afternoon session with labs
17:00-17:15 - Daily wrap-up and environment cleanup
```

### **Learning Approach:**

**"This is hands-on learning with guided discovery. I won't give you all the answers immediately - I'll guide you to find solutions. This builds real problem-solving skills."**

#### **When You Get Stuck:**

1. **Try to solve it with your team first (5 minutes)**
2. **Check with the other team if they've seen the issue**
