```python
# Automated deployment of realistic legacy resources using CloudFormation
# Location: cloudformation/ directory

Templates Created:
1. legacy-production-resources.yaml - Production account with violations
2. legacy-development-resources.yaml - Development account with conflicts
3. deploy-legacy-resources.sh - Automated deployment script
4. setup-aws-profiles.sh - AWS CLI profile configuration

Legacy Resources Deployed:
Production Accounts (Team 1 & 2):
